# Base64 Encryption/Decryption  
*In a world of secrecy, keep your information encrypted!*  
This is a simple Python2 script that will allow you to encrypt a string of text, and then decrypt it later when you need it most.  
As we go on our lives, and we have multiple passwords for virtually everything encrypting your passwords and decrypting them later is probably one of the most secured things you can do.  
We all talk about password managers right? Open up a text document, encrypt your passwords, save it as something like PasswordsBase64 or what ever you want.  
And then when you need it, just decrypt it.  
  
## How to Encrypt  
*Encryption is Privacy!*  
If you want to encrypt something, you can simply type the following command;  
```
$ python2 b64encrypt.py mypassword
  ==NMl92qmAKLjyKo
**Base64 Encrypted String**
```
Copy & Paste that in a text file some where. Even if it is on a Thumb Drive!  
  
## How to Decrypt  
*Decryption Gives Us Access!*  
Naturally, we need to decrypt our own encryption. And we can do that like this;  
```
$ python2 b64decrypt.py ==NMl92qmAKLjyKo  
mypassword
**Base64 Decrypted String**
```
